Approach for this Project:The project aimed to predict whether an avocado is conventional or organic. using Deep learning models. The dataset was loaded and explored to gain insights into the data, followed by preprocessing steps such as handling missing values and feature scaling. Three models were developed: Feedforward Neural Network (FNN),TabNet, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Each model was trained and evaluated based on accuracy.
